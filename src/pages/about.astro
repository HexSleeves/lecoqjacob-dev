      I’m Jacob — a software developer based in Youngsville, Louisiana. <p>
        My work revolves around building clean, performant web applications that
        solve real problems. I’m not here to wow you with buzzwords; I care
        about shipping code that works and improving the lives of the people who
        use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m raising a spirited two‑year‑old. It’s a daily
        exercise in patience and problem‑solving that makes debugging production
        issues feel easy by comparison. I’m also managing small intestine
        bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which means I have to be intentional about
        my diet and health. This experience reminds me that technology only
        matters if it helps people live better lives. My vision is
        straightforward: use my skills to create digital tools that are both
        useful and sustainable. I’m always experimenting with new frameworks
        (yes, including Astro) and paying attention to what’s coming next,
        because stagnation is the enemy of progress. If you’re looking for
        someone who values clarity over fluff and substance over hype, you’re in
        the right place.
