    <p>
      I’m Jacob — a software developer based in Youngsville, Louisiana. <p>
        My work revolves around building clean, performant web applications that
        solve real problems. I’m not here to wow you with buzzwords; I care
        about shipping code that works and improving the lives of the people who
        use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m raising a spirited two‑year‑old on my own. It’s a
        daily exercise in patience and problem‑solving that makes debugging
        production issues feel easy by comparison. I’m health focused, which
        means I have to be intentional about what I eat and how I take care of
        myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        My vision is straightforward: use my skills to create digital tools that
        are both useful and sustainable. I’m always experimenting with new
        frameworks (yes, including Astro) and paying attention to what’s coming
        next, because stagnation is the enemy of progress. If you’re looking for
        someone who values clarity over fluff and substance over hype, you’re in
        the right place.
