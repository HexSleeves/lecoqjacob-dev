## The Details

This project is all about learning, experimentation, and pushing the boundaries of functional game development.

## The Features

- Turn-based, entity-driven roguelike with a focus on extensibility and clarity.
- Entity-Component System (ECS): All game objects are entities with flexible, composable components.
- Infinite/Procedural World: Powered by a dynamic chunking system for seamless exploration.
- Modern OCaml: Uses the Base library, functional patterns, and Raylib bindings for graphics/input/audio.
- Modular Architecture: Clean separation of UI, core logic, resources, and utilities.
