## The Details

A mini-tutorial series I wrote that can be found here, where I explore how bevy setups up compute shaders using their game of life example.

## The Features

- Camera Controller
- Wrapping Simulation
- Drawing on the simulation
- Storage / Uniform Buffers
- Heatmap for visual effects :D
- Seperate color pipeline to distinquish between compute shaders
